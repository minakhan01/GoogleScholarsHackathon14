<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(id, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a YouTube video.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies the YouTube video ID for the resource that is being deleted. In a video resource, the id property specifies the video's ID. (required)
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request's authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The actual CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getRating">getRating(id, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the ratings that the authorized user gave to a list of specified videos.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies a comma-separated list of the YouTube video ID(s) for the resource(s) for which you are retrieving rating data. In a video resource, the id property specifies the video's ID. (required)
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request's authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value.

It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "items": [ # A list of ratings that match the request criteria.
      {
        "rating": "A String",
        "videoId": "A String",
      },
    ],
    "kind": "youtube#videoGetRatingResponse", # Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "youtube#videoGetRatingResponse".

    <code class="details" id="insert">insert(part=None, body=None, media_body=None, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, stabilize=None, onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel=None, notifySubscribers=None, autoLevels=None)</code>
  <pre>Uploads a video to YouTube and optionally sets the video's metadata.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include.

The part names that you can include in the parameter value are snippet, contentDetails, fileDetails, liveStreamingDetails, player, processingDetails, recordingDetails, statistics, status, suggestions, and topicDetails. However, not all of those parts contain properties that can be set when setting or updating a video's metadata. For example, the statistics object encapsulates statistics that YouTube calculates for a video and does not contain values that you can set or modify. If the parameter value specifies a part that does not contain mutable values, that part will still be included in the API response. (required)

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request's authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
  stabilize: boolean, The stabilize parameter indicates whether YouTube should adjust the video to remove shaky camera motions.
  onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel: string, This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.

This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
  notifySubscribers: boolean, The notifySubscribers parameter indicates whether YouTube should send notification to subscribers about the inserted video.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(part=None, pageToken=None, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, locale=None, chart=None, maxResults=None, regionCode=None, myRating=None, videoCategoryId=None, id=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns a list of videos that match the API request parameters.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more video resource properties that the API response will include. The part names that you can include in the parameter value are id, snippet, contentDetails, fileDetails, liveStreamingDetails, player, processingDetails, recordingDetails, statistics, status, suggestions, and topicDetails.

If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response. For example, in a video resource, the snippet property contains the channelId, title, description, tags, and categoryId properties. As such, if you set part=snippet, the API response will contain all of those properties. (required)
  pageToken: string, The pageToken parameter identifies a specific page in the result set that should be returned. In an API response, the nextPageToken and prevPageToken properties identify other pages that could be retrieved.

Note: This parameter is supported for use in conjunction with the myRating parameter, but it is not supported for use in conjunction with the id parameter.
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request's authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
  locale: string, DEPRECATED
  chart: string, The chart parameter identifies the chart that you want to retrieve.
    Allowed values
      mostPopular - Return the most popular videos for the specified content region and video category.
  maxResults: integer, The maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set.

Note: This parameter is supported for use in conjunction with the myRating parameter, but it is not supported for use in conjunction with the id parameter.
  regionCode: string, The regionCode parameter instructs the API to select a video chart available in the specified region. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with the chart parameter. The parameter value is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
  myRating: string, Set this parameter's value to like or dislike to instruct the API to only return videos liked or disliked by the authenticated user.
    Allowed values
      dislike - Returns only videos disliked by the authenticated user.
      like - Returns only video liked by the authenticated user.
  videoCategoryId: string, The videoCategoryId parameter identifies the video category for which the chart should be retrieved. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with the chart parameter. By default, charts are not restricted to a particular category.
  id: string, The id parameter specifies a comma-separated list of the YouTube video ID(s) for the resource(s) that are being retrieved. In a video resource, the id property specifies the video's ID.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="rate">rate(id, rating, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None)</code>
  <pre>Add a like or dislike rating to a video or remove a rating from a video.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies the YouTube video ID of the video that is being rated or having its rating removed. (required)
  rating: string, Specifies the rating to record. (required)
    Allowed values
      dislike - Records that the authenticated user disliked the video.
      like - Records that the authenticated user liked the video.
      none - Removes any rating that the authenticated user had previously set for the video.
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request's authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(part=None, body, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a video's metadata.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include.

The part names that you can include in the parameter value are snippet, contentDetails, fileDetails, liveStreamingDetails, player, processingDetails, recordingDetails, statistics, status, suggestions, and topicDetails.

Note that this method will override the existing values for all of the mutable properties that are contained in any parts that the parameter value specifies. For example, a video's privacy setting is contained in the status part. As such, if your request is updating a private video, and the request's part parameter value includes the status part, the video's privacy setting will be updated to whatever value the request body specifies. If the request body does not specify a value, the existing privacy setting will be removed and the video will revert to the default privacy setting.

In addition, not all of those parts contain properties that can be set when setting or updating a video's metadata. For example, the statistics object encapsulates statistics that YouTube calculates for a video and does not contain values that you can set or modify. If the parameter value specifies a part that does not contain mutable values, that part will still be included in the API response. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
